Bigram language model (not large)

A bigram represents two consective characters. Finding the probablities of certain bigrams being connected to each other in a word allows a neural network to generate names that are plausible-ish sounding.

This is based of of Neural Networks Zero to Hero part one by Andrej Karpathy.
